dotMatrix-Android
=================

the dotMatrix drum machine for Android

Using libpd and processing with controlP5, selectFile, and APWidget 
to make a cool analog style drum machine..

You should be able to import this as an existing android project into Eclipse.

All libraries are included in the lib folder. 

this isn't the most optimized code, many quirks and bottlenecks, on the redux I will 
be releasing it in OpenFrameworks C++
